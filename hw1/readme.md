Here is a simple instruction.

Current GuitarHeroLite.java builds a 37 key synthesizer, which is ["Just For Fun" part in hw1 of UCB cs61b sp16](http://datastructur.es/sp16/materials/hw/hw1/hw1.html#just-for-fun-building-a-37-key-synthesizer).

If needed, anyone can uncomment guitar part and comment keyboard part to obtain orginal hw1 solutions for Task 1 to Task 5. "Even More Fun" part is not implemented. Everyone can try it by yourself. 

Have fun! :)
